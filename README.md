🚀 Bitcoin Trading — Enhancing Speed and Accuracy

📘 Overview

This project focuses on predictive analysis and trading optimization in the Bitcoin market. It leverages machine learning and deep learning techniques to improve both speed and accuracy of trade decisions, helping traders identify profitable entry and exit points in real time.

By combining data-driven insights, technical indicators, and AI-based models, this project aims to build a reliable system for cryptocurrency trading support.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze real-time and historical Bitcoin price data

Build models that predict short-term price trends

Enhance trading speed and accuracy using machine learning

Evaluate model performance with metrics such as RMSE, accuracy, and profit ratios

🧩 Key Features

Data preprocessing and feature engineering from Bitcoin price datasets

Integration of technical indicators (EMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands)

Implementation of ML/DL models (e.g., LSTM, Random Forest, or CNN-based networks)

Visualization of model predictions vs. actual prices

Real-time trading signal generation (Buy, Hold, Sell)
